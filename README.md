# 8-bit ALU with Adder,Subtractor, Multiplier and Divider (Verilog)

## Overview
This project implements an 8-bit combinational ALU supporting:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The design is written in synthesizable Verilog and verified using a custom testbench.

## Features
- 8-bit Carry Look-Ahead Adder
- Custom gate-level multiplier
- Restoring division algorithm
- Status flags: Zero (Z), Negative (N), Carry (C)
- Fully simulated in Vivado
